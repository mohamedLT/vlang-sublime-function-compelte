# vlang-sublime-function-compelte
this is a plugin that adds functions autocomplete for v lang in sublime I made it to make it easier to use v without the need to check the docs every second

to install it basically drop the vlan.py in sublime text/Packages/User and that is it 

for the time being, it just has function completion but I am working on a full autocomplete system for the future

if you find an issue please do tell me 

I hope you enjoy
